  <p>Hi Babiiiii,</p>
  <p>
    I just want to take a quiet moment to let you know how thankful I am for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    You don’t need to do anything grand to be special just you, as you are, is already more than enough. Whether we’re laughing, talking about random things, or even just sitting in silence, I always feel calm and safe when I’m with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for your patience. Thank you for your little reminders. Thank you for noticing the things I forget to say out loud. You care in ways that are so soft, so subtle, but they mean everything to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    You bring so much light into my life not because you try, but simply because that’s who you are. And I hope you never forget that even on the days when you feel tired, quiet, or unsure, you are still deeply appreciated, deeply loved, and deeply enough.
  </p>
  <p>
    Happy National Girlfriend’s Day. You matter so much more than you realize.
  </p>
